# Studying README

Just a place to practice.

## Usage

We set up a virtual environment on WSL2 (replicate with `sudo apt install virtualenv; virtualenv .; source bin/activate`).

## Graphs

We're starting with graphs, as they are one of the most extensible data structures that exist. The goals of this section are:
- Construct abstractions around undirected and directed graphs.
  - And DAGs
- Implement graph traversal algorithms
- Implement SSSP algorithm (Dijkstra's)
- Implement toposort on DAGs
